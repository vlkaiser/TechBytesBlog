title: Job Application Tips for New Engineers or Students
---

Welcome you talented, passionate, creative individuals!

I've seen candidate and intern resumes come past my desk countless times.  Talented people that aren't even considered.  Why not?  Well, there can be a few reasons.

### 1. **Not reading the directions.** 
It's painful to dismiss an otherwise good candidate because they didn't follow the directions.  If an applicant can't follow directions and spend the time and effort up front - it probably won't get better if they're hired.  
**Follow. The. Directions.**

### 2. Cover Letters:
If an employer asks for a cover letter, spend some time and write or modify a cover letter.  It should be **tailored to the Job Description.**  Include those key words.  Brush up if you don't know or are a little rusty on those key words.  Expand on points of conversation that don't get hit in your resume.  They're two seperate but complimentary documents.

### 3. Portfolios:
If an employer asks for a portfolio, they are looking to assess your past work.  Why would you hand them a few photos or worse - nothing at all?   
Remember, these are engineers busy with their own work.  They want cliff notes. Short concise summaries.  They want to visualize your work integrated in the team.  
1. **Did you read what they were asking for in the portfolio, and include ALL of those things?**  (Ignore your HS english teacher here.  List out what they want, and fill in the blanks.  This is not a 30 page thesis).
2. **Did you explain what they're looking at?** I've gotten links to repositories (yay!) but no instructions on how to build the project. (??? *Use ReadMe files people.*)  I've received photos of awesome robots - and have no idea what they do or what the applicant contributed.  
You would document projects you do for the company, show them that same level of effort in your portfolio.
3. **Make it look nice.**  If you wouldn't submit it for a grade, don't submit it to an employer.  Check your spelling and punctuation.  Format it nicely. I recommend a PDF so it looks the way you intended on any system.

### 4. Resumes:
Spoiler alert: I probably don't care about you entire job history.  Keep those not-totally-relevant sections brief.  If you think they are relevant, expand on it in your cover letter - great conversation segue.

I **do** care that in your spare time you take online courses in python, or have been working on an automated plant watering system, or enjoy designing 3D printed widgets.   
Tell me tangible, measurable things you did/do **outside** the classroom.  Clubs, hobby projects, fixing people's broken electronics.  Demonstrate your creativity and passion.

I hope this was helpful to anyone out there who's applying for jobs.  It's tough out there, but set yourself apart and get your foot in the door with a great first impression that shows you **_care_** as well as how talented you are.
