### 5. Bonus
This is just a few tips to give yourself an edge.  (Ok, these are mostly for EE/ECE)
1. Learn to Solder.  
It's a valuable skill with a low cost to get started.  
An entry level soldering iron kit is $10.  A soldering project kit is also $10 or less.   

2. Arduino or similar introductory microcontrollers.  
There are lots of flavors.  I reccommend getting started with an UNO variant.  
If you don't have any hardware, the starter kits are under $40 and come with the board.  
The IDE is free.  Run through a few tutorials.  
If you want a more "real world" application, try programming in VSCode instead of the Arduino IDE, 
or try a different development board - try an STMicro Nucleo, TI Launchpad, Microchip Xplained, Cypress PSoC or other.

3. 3D Design  
Again, many flavors.  Fusion360, Tinkercad, Sketchup, Solidworks - it's great to be able to design enclosures.  
Bonus points if you print it, or send out to have it printed.

4. PCB Layout  
Mostly for the EECEs.  It's daunting, but YouTube has a lot of tutorials.  Pick a schematic PCB program like KiCad, PCB123 or other.  
You can (and should) have have them fabricated.  It's surprisingly inexpensive if you're willing to wait.

5. As you do your labs/academic coursework...
Set yourself a challenge and figure out why you're learning this.
What skills am I developing here?
What real-world applications does this have?
How could I use this in a product that could be sold?

Start with the quintessential "hello world" or "blink the led" projects.  Why are these so important?

Then challenge yourself to make it more productive, and solve a problem.
Knowing isn't useful unless you can use it.

Stuck?  Ask your classmates.  Ask your TA.  Ask your instructor.  Ask a mentor.  Ask the internet!
Engineering just does not happen in a vaccuum.  Bounce ideas off each other.


Now put these on your resume for a definite edge.
