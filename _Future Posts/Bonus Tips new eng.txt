### 5. Bonus
This is just a few tips to give yourself an edge.  (Ok, these are mostly for EEMECE)
1. Learn to Solder.  
It's a valuable skill with a low cost to get started.  
An entry level soldering iron kit is $10.  A soldering project kit is also $10 or less.   

2. Arduino or similar.  
There are lots of flavors.  I reccommend getting started with an UNO variant.  If you don't have any hardware, the starter kits are under $40 and come with the board.  The IDE is free.  Run through a few tutorials.  

3. 3D Design  
Again, many flavors.  Fusion360, Tinkercad, Sketchup, Solidworks - it's great to be able to design enclosures.  Bonus points if you print or send out to have it printed.

4. PCB Layout  
Mostly for the EECEs.  It's daunting, but YouTube has a lot of tutorials.  Pick a schematicPCB program like KiCad, Eagle, or other.  You can (and should) have have them fabricated for not too much if you're willing to wait.

Now put these on your resume for a definite edge.
